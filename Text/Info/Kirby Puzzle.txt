Kirby Slide Puzzle is a simple sliding puzzle contained on a single e-card. The player is presented with an eight tile image of Kirby that has been jumbled, the goal being to shift the pieces and restore his image.

The card was produced to help advertise for a cartoon based on the Kirby character and world, Kirby: Right Back at Ya!, as well as the clusters of cartoons run by Fox called, The FoxBox.

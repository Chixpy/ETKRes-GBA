In what can only be described as a bad idea voltorb is rolling himself down a cliff sprinkled with jagged rocks. What makes this such a bad idea is that voltorb is highly explosive!

In this game you will roll down a slope being able to control your movement to the left and right. See how long you'll be able to flit between the rocks and keep from exploding! A magnemite will occasionally float by, knocking into it will borrow it's electric power. This power allows you to blast your way through rocks for a short time.

The game can be accessed by scanning the long dot-code on the Pokemon-e Aquapolis cards Voltorb (64/147), Magnemite (52/147), Magnemite (91/147), and Voltorb (115/147).  Or in Japan Pokemon e-card expansion 2 cards Voltorb (33/92), Voltorb (34/92), Magnemite (32/92), and Magnemite (72/92).

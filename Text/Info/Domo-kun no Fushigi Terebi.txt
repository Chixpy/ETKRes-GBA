A meteorite destroys Usaji's television satellite, causing Domo-kun to become frustrated at their now non-functional TV.  After hitting it several times, Domo-kun is sucked into the television and finds himself in a variety of programming.

Domo-kun is the mascot for NHK (one of Japan's major broadcasting companies). In his first Game Boy Advance title, Domo must pass various mini-games in order to return to the world outside of the television. Games include (among others) hatching birds in a nature show, successfully hitting home runs in the baseball broadcast and getting the beat right in a rhythm action game.

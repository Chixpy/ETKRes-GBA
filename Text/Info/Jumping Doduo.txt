You're a fun loving doduo out for a run, so you're not going to let those other pokémon get in your way. In this game you'll use either the A or B button to jump over bellsprouts, bulbasaurs, dugtrios, donphans, sudowoodos and boulders. 

The goal is to see how long you can last before touching one of these creatures, some are easier to hit than other. Once you lose the poor doduo will cry in shame.

The game can be accessed by scanning the long dot-code on the Pokemon-e Aquapolis cards Doduo (73/147) and Dodrio (46/147). Or in Japan Pokemon e-card expansion 3 cards Doduo (61/87) and Dodrio (62/87).

A full day of work for a machop, as everyone knows, is pulverizing bouncing boulders with its bare hands. This game allows you to take the role of a machop who has the respectable workload of one hundred boulders ahead of him. 

Boulders will bounce from the left and right sides of the screen. Some will make little bounces along the ground that you wont be able to avoid, others describe parabolas which offer significant head room. If machop gets beaned by one of the flying rocks the game is over, will you survive all one hundred? You'll be rewarded by an evolution to machoke at fifty boulders smashed, and machamp at one hundred.

The A button does a punch in the direction you are facing while B punches upward.

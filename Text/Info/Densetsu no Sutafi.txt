Densetsu no Stafi is a tale of a yellow star that fell into the ocean from the home castle in the clouds. With a company of Kyorosuke the clam, he must now make his way all the way back. During his journey he will help out the local seabed community with small and big problems, and finally he will confront with the main villain: Ogura, the dark eel.

Gameplay is similar to other platformers made by Nintendo, especially to Kirby and Mario series.

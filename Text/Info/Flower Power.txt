Control butterfree as he collects nectar from flowers. The goal is to collect as much nectar as possible before being hit by a beedrill or weezing. Beedrills will try to hit you, while weezings are stationary obstacles.

The game scrolls to the left allowing you to fly around the screen that is available. Pressing A will make you fly higher.

The game can be accessed by scanning the long dot-code on the Pokemon-e Expedition cards Butterfree (38/165), Metapod (87/165), and Caterpie (96/165). Or in Japan Pokemon e-card expansion 1 cards, Butterfree (66/128), Metapod (33/128), and Caterpie (3/128).

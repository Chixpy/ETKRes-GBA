Guru Logi Champ is a Japanese-only puzzle game.  In it, you control a cannon manned by two ducks.  Each level shows a grid with missing blocks that you must fill in using your cannon.  You can only fire and suck in certain bricks from this grid, and any blocks you shoot must land on another block so that they stop moving.  It's up to you to use a combination of shooting and sucking, as well as rotating the screen using the L and R Buttons, to fill in any missing blocks from the grid.  When this is complete, the level will end, and you will be shown that the missing blocks created a picture.

The game has a series of levels, each with their own set of puzzles.  There is a main goal for each level.  In one, ducks in spiky eggshells have stolen a tap handle, and a thirsty athlete needs a drink of water.  You need to solve a set amount of puzzles before you can break the last puzzle in the stage open, solve it, and reclaim the item needed to help the person or people for that stage.

Multiplayer mode features the same basic mechanics as single player, except that the puzzles are extremely simplified (usually not requiring more than four blocks to fill).  Each player has their own puzzle grid to manipulate, and the first player to fill in all of their blocks wins the round.  This makes for some very hectic and close matches against other players.  Whoever wins the most out of the preset amount of rounds wins the game.

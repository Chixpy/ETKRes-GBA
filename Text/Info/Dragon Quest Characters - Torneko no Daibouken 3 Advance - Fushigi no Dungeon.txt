Following the events of the previous game, Torneko despite his success has again grown restless and looking for adventure. He uses his money to build a ship and head out over the great sea to explore lands unknown. However, the same day he is celebrating his birthday, a great tidal wave rises up and destroys his boat. Torneko, along with his wife and son, are recovered by the villagers of a small island. In gratitude, Torneko agrees to help them with the monster problem they've been having from a Mysterious Dungeon nearby cave. And as usual, he will try to discover rare and valuable items in the cave which he can use to reestablish his fortune.

Little Pichu and Togepi are jammin' to the tunes, but it's up to Pikachu to keep the music flowing. It seems that power is in short supply so Pikachu will have to use his electric powers to supply energy to the stereo and speakers. 

You'll move the electric rodent left and right and use A to jolt the audio equipment back to life. When the stereo or a speaker starts turning gray it's time to zap it, if you fail to do so it will explode. Once you lose a speaker fun's over and the two baby dancers will collapse.

The game can be accessed by scanning the long dot-code on the Pokemon-e Skybridge cards Pikachu (84/144), Raichu (27/144), Persian (42/144), Meowth (78/144). Or in Japan the Pokemon e-card expansion 4 cards Pikachu (33/88), Raichu (34/88), Meowth (62/88), Persian (63/88).

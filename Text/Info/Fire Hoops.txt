In fire hoops your goal is to set 100 hoops on fire by leaping through them as the flaming horse Rapidash. The game starts with Rapidash running across a field when a golden bird, Ho-oh, flies ahead of him. Rapidash gives chase.

Rapidash stays on the left side of the screen while rushing towards the hoops. Pressing up on the d-pad will initiate a jump, how long you hold the direction will dictate how high the jump is. One missed hoop and the game resets.

The game can be accessed by scanning the long dot-code on the Pokemon-e Expedition cards, Rapidash (51) - version 1/2 and Ho-oh (52) - version 1/2. Version 1 was included with the November 2002 issue of Nintendo Power magazine, while version 2 was given away for free at the Pokémon Center in New York City.

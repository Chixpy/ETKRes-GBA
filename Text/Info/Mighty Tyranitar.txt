Purple skies indicate a beautiful sunset, correct? Wrong. They indicate erupting volcanoes! Good thing that Tyranitar spotted this one, he's not going to let a single one of the flaming rocks the mountain is spewing past!

Move Tyranitar left and right while pressing A to fire your 'hyper beam' to destroy any incoming volcanic debris. Letting a single one past or being hit by one will end the game. How high a score can you get?

The game can be accessed by scanning the long dot-code on the Pokemon-e Aquapolis cards Pupitar (56/147), Tyranitar (40/147), Kangaskhan (88/147), Larvitar (89/147), and Onix (98/147). Or in Japan Pokemon e-card expansion 3 cards Pupitar (60/87), Larvitar (59/87), Tyranitar (70/87), Onix (56/87), and Kangaskhan (64/87).

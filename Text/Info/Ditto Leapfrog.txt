Kingler, who was seen in his previous game tossing fish to the firmament, has returned to hurl magikarps and goldeens, among other water pokémon, back into the bayou from which they came. Unfortunately his arm is all worn out from throwing them so far in the first place, so his tosses are falling just shy of the water. Luckily a heliotrope blob with a caricature of a face, Ditto, arrives on the scene. This rubbery creature is able to bounce the pokéfish just far enough to make it back to their watery homes.

The directional pad will allow you to move left and right so as to catch the fish on dittos back. As your score increases so will the speed that Kingler will throw the water Pokémon. The goal of the game is to try to get the highest score you can. After you miss three fish the game ends.

The game can be accessed by scanning the long dot-code on the Pokemon-e Skyridge cards, Ditto (51/144), Granbull (61/144), Snubbull (101/144). Or in Japan the Pokemon e-card expansion 5 cards Ditto (64/88), Granbull (69/88), Snubbull (68/88).

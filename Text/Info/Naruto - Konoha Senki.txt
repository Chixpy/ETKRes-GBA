This game is a strategy/RPG game based on the popular manga/anime Naruto. With the use of ninja tools such as shuriken and kunai, and ninjutsu such as Naruto's Kage Bunshin (Doppelganger) or Sasuke's flame techniques. Fighting random no-name ninjas as well as plot enemies taken directly from the manga, you fight your way through three scenarios filled with many different missions, spanning the initial training of Kakashi's Team 7 up until the end of the Chuunin test.

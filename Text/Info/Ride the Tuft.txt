Cleffa must make its way to the clefairy on the opposite size of a ravine. For the pink little puff to make it there she will need to leap onto dandelion seeds that float by. Most of these tufts slowly sink once you land, although some will still push their way heavenward. Miss a jump though and you'll end up as ekans foods. 

The way to raise your score is to make fantastic leaps and to get to the next tuft, and to cross the gorge as quickly as possible. An arrow will appear in the lower left hand corner of the screen with a number indicating how far away from your target you are. Should this arrow be flashing this means you are too low and will crash into the cliff face.

The game can be accessed by scanning the long dot-code on the Pokemon-e Skyridge cards, Cleffa (48/144), Rattata (90/144), Shuckle (96/144), and Yanma (116/144). Or in Japan the Pokemon e-card expansion 4 cards Yanma (10/88), Cleffa (66//88), Schukle (14/88), and Rattata (60/88).

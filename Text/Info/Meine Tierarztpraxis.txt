In My Vet Practice - GBA you will become a veterinarian and build up your own vet practice, decide which building you will expand next and which patients you will medicate. Every day people come to your practice with guinea pigs, rabbits, budgerigars, cats, dogs and horses.
Build up special stables and enclosures for the different species. Feeding, playing, keeping company and even grooming are your daily tasks. Even if the work with the animals is a lot of fun, you will need a little time to yourself. Take your own horse for a ride across the fields.

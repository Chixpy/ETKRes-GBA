In this game you will have a swimming race against two water based pokémon, marill and golduck. You are a poliwrath, some sort of mutant frog. The race is very short so you'll really have to put your back into it to beat these splendid swimmers.

Pressing a will slow you down but charge up your stroke, B will do the same but more so, deciding which stroke to use based on your opponents speed will determine if you win or lose. Try to beat your best time!

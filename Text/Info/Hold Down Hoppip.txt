As pichu, a baby electric rat, you must keep five buoyant hoppips, some form of cotton onion creature, that have been tethered to the ground from flying off.  

The hoppips will continuously move upwards at different rates, you can rush over to them and use the A button to pull them back earthwards. The game ends when a hoppip escapes your terrestrial care and goes so high that the cord holding it breaks. The aim of the game is to get the best high score you can.

The game can be accessed by scanning the long dot-code on the Pokemon-e Expedition cards Hoppip (112/165) and Pichu (58/165). Or in Japan the Pokemon e-card expansion 1 cards Hoppip (2/128) and Pichu (82/128).

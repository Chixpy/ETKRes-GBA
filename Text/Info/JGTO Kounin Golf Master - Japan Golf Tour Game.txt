JGTO Kounin Golf Master: Japan Golf Tour Game is the first in the genre to appear on the GBA platform as one of the Japanese launch games. The game features 14 characters and multiple courses with different themes and with about 20 holes each. There is a match mode to go against AI-controlled players to beat their ranking or another mode for just one player.

Gameplay is divided into two different parts. Players use a top-down overview to track the ball and the hole, while the putting and swinging is done from a third-person perspective. Taking the wind into account, players can choose from different clubs, determine the direction and finally the strength of the shot based on a moving bar requiring the player's timing for accuracy. Obstacles on the course such as sand or trees influence the shots and there are also different weather conditions. In the match mode games are announced by a TV anchor. The game keeps detailed statistics of the score and the player's handicap. Courses and new characters are unlocked gradually.

Most of the game's content was later used in the US GBA game ESPN Final Round Golf 2002 with some minor differences.

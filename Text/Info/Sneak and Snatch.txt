SudoWoodo has developed a hankering for fruit. Being a stone tree he can't pick his own and instead must plunder the stores of his fellows. SudoWoodo's mark today is a hapless totodile. But he'll have to be quick as totodile is also interested in snacking on some of that fruit.

You move SudoWoodo by pressing A & B alternately. If you press either to long you'll fall on your face. There is however strategy in falling, totodile will be looking your way every now and then when you're on the ground totodile can't see you! If you take to long totodile will eat one of the fruits, if he eats them all you'll lose. Points are awarded based on how many fruits you get. Once you have made off with the fruit the game restarts at a higher difficulty.

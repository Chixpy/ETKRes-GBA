In this game you control a mighty bear-type pokémon called urasing. As this creature you'll want to provide sustenance for your teddy bear-esque offspring two twin teddiursa.

By following a certain button pattern that will be displayed on the screen your bear will be able to shake a berry tree thereby dislodging the berries, the teddiursa will pick up and count the berries. You'll be given a number of berries to collect to progress to the next level of difficulty, should you fail to do that the game will end.

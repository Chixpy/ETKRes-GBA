As Aipom, a monkey with a hand for a tail, you collect ripe fruits as they fall from trees. However, if a single one lands it will attract vermin known as swinubs and the game will end. This season fruit is not alone in being ripe, little acorn critters called sunkerns will also fall from the trees getting hit with them will stun Aipom.

You can move forwards, backwards, left, and right with the d-pad and use the A button to jump for fruit.

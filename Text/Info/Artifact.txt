Artifact is a puzzlegame based on the principles of the Chinese tilegame Mahjongg. In this game three variations are combined into one game, namely Shanghai, Rivers and Memory. The game includes the normal single play, time trial and a one-on-one battlemode by use of the GBA's link cable (you need an extra cartridge though).

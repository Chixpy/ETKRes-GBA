Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots is a handheld fighting game based on the toy line of the same name. It's a one-on-one fighting game where the player takes control of a robot inside a boxing ring and battles against other robots. Each robot has a special move that can be used after filling up a special bar. By combining different button presses the player can unleash a robotic rampage for extra damage against the enemy. It's also possible to do charged punches by holding down the attack button. Once one of the robots has lost all of its health, a concussion mini game is started. Here the player can perform a finishing move by alternately tapping the L and R buttons. 

Three game modes exists. The classic mode where the player can choose to play as either the Red Rocker or the Blue Bomber is a one-off game. In the versus mode it's possible to choose from some additional robots as well as some different arenas. In the title fight mode, the player starts out with the Red Rocker and then has to unlock the other by winning the fights against them.

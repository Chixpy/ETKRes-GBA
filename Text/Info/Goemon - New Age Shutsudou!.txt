A sequel of sorts of Ganbare Goemon: Shin Sedai Shumei, New Age Shutsudo takes you back to the world of the updated Goemon in which you control a younger and less humorous version of Goemon who fights crime in modern Japan instead of the classic wacky ninja that tries to save feudal Japan and originated the Ganbare Goemon series.

Borrowing the template from the previous portable title in the series, the game thrusts you in the shoes of either Goemon or his pal Ebisu as they traverse side-scrolling stages attempting to defeat all enemies within and ultimately save the city.

Between levels you take control of the rest of Goemon's friends in bonus rounds as they take on specific challenges, and the game also brings back the Impact sequences, in which you take control of giant mechas in first-person sequences and attempt to defeat certain bosses.
